## ✍🏻 General Description
This project aims to predict students' exam performance based on study habits, demographics, and environmental factors. The dataset contains 20.000 records and 13 variables like student’s academic behavior, study habits, lifestyle routines, and exam conditions. The exam score (0–100) is derived using a weighted formula that mimics real-life academic performance patterns. These variables collectively help understand how different aspects of a student’s daily life and learning environment influence their exam outcomes. The dataset contains no personally identifiable information and is suitable for educational research, statistical exploration, behavior analysis, institution-level studies, and general data-driven insights.

The project includes:
* Data cleaning and preparation (outlier detection and treatment)
* Normalization of variables and measurement units
* Exploratory visualizations
* Analytical insights into lifestile routines, study habits and academic behavior
* Hypothesis evaluation to lay the groundwork for future predictive models
